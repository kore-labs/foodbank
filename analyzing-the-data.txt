To check to see when things are no longer on the market
I can check to see when it does not appear in the query for a checkin date.

to do this i may need to use PHP

Running a query?

$rows = Select * from rentals //where...


//Initialize the new array with dates and zeros...
$sorted_rentals['unique_id'] = array();
while(date < $maxDate ){
  $sorted_rentals['unique_id'][$date] = 0;
}

//Store each row by its ID in a hash table of arrays
$sorted_rentals[$row['unique_id']][$row['date']] = $row;
